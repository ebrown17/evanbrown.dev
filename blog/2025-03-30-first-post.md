`git commit -m 'initial commit'`... hmm what actually this is my first post? blog message?. I am not really sure what I want to call this, but this will be my first time writing in this medium.
<!-- truncate -->

I do a lot of some what interesting things at my job, piecing together many things from all over the internet. A higher percentage of my job(much higher then what I would actually like), requires converting legacy applications/systems to more modern applications/systems or finding ways to get legacy applications to run on more modern systems.

These posts will be my contributions back to all that I have learned and also a place to get my thoughts on technologies and software that I use.

This first post will just be a short introduction about myself, my work history and whatever else comes to my mind.
