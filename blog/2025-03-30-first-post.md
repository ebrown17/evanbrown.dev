`git commit -m 'initial commit'`... hmm wait.. actually, this is my first post or is it blog message?. I am not really sure what I want to call this, but this will be my first time writing in this medium.
<!-- truncate -->

I do a lot of some what interesting things at my job, solving problems that require piecing together many things from all over the internet. A high percentage of my job(much higher then what I would actually like), requires converting legacy applications/systems to more modern applications/systems or finding ways to get legacy applications to run on more modern systems.

I want to give back some of what I have been able to figure out during my toils, and I would hope it would help those who have to do similar things.

This first post will just be a short introduction about myself, my work history and whatever else comes to my mind.
