`git commit -m 'initial commit'`... hmm wait.. actually, this is my first post or is it blog message?. I am not really sure what I want to call this, but this will be my first time writing in this medium, well I guess any medium that someone other then myself of a manager might read, so it will be interesting to see how the reading flow will change over time.

I do a lot of some what interesting things at my job, solving problems that require piecing together many things from all over the internet. A high percentage of my job(much higher then what I would actually like), requires converting legacy applications/systems to more modern applications/systems or finding ways to get legacy applications to run on more modern systems.

This first post is just me figuring out how to use Docusaurus, Github pages, and pointing them at my domain, so it won't have much content.

I want to give back some of what I have learned over the years and I hope it can be a resource others can use.
