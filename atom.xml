        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>git commit -m 'initial commit'</code>... hmm wait.. actually, this is my first post or is it blog message?. I am not really sure what I want to call this, but this will be my first time writing in this medium, well I guess any medium that someone other then myself of a manager might read, so it will be interesting to see how the reading flow will change over time.</p>
<p>I do a lot of some what interesting things at my job, solving problems that require piecing together many things from all over the internet. A high percentage of my job(much higher then what I would actually like), requires converting legacy applications/systems to more modern applications/systems or finding ways to get legacy applications to run on more modern systems.</p>
<p>This first post is just me figuring out how to use Docusaurus, Github pages, and pointing them at my domain, so it won't have much content.</p>
<p>I want to give back some of what I have learned over the years and I hope it can be a resource others can use.</p>]]></content>
